          Starts a new interactive diagnostic session.


          Specify coding scheme for concepts and provide the patient's initial
          information (age, sex, and chief complaints) to create a session and
          receive the first question. The session is stateful and managed on the
          server.


          ### Workflow

          1.  Provide either `input_text` (e.g., "I have a headache and a
          fever") or a list of `chief_findings_codes`.

          2.  The system processes the initial data and generates the first,
          most relevant question.

          3.  A unique `session_id` is returned, which you must use for all
          subsequent calls to the `update_session` endpoint.
