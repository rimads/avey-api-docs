          Submits an answer to the previous question and retrieves the next one.


          ### Workflow after session creation:

          1.  The client displays the question received from the previous call.

          2.  The user provides an answer.

          3.  The client sends this answer in the request body to this endpoint,
          either as the free text of a user, or as an `answers` object.

          4.  The diagnostic model processes the answer, updates the patient's
          profile, and determines the next best question.

          5.  If more questions are needed, a new `question` object is returned.

          6.  If the model converges towards a final diagnosis, the `question`
          field in the response will be. At this point, you should use the final
          `patient_info` object to call the main `/diagnose` endpoint.
