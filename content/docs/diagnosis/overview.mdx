## Data Types

### Coding Systems

- `icd-10-cm`: ICD-10 Clinical Modification
- `snomed-ct`: SNOMED Clinical Terms
- `avey-kr`: Avey Knowledge Representation

### Finding Status

- `present`: Patient has symptom
- `absent`: Patient doesn't have symptom
- `unsure`: Patient uncertain

### Question Types

- **Text**: Standard yes/no questions
- **Image**: Body maps for location identification

### Urgency Levels

- `Urgent`: Immediate attention needed
- `Non-Urgent`: Routine care
- `Home Treatable`: Self-manageable

## Workflow

1. Create session with patient info
2. Ask questions and submit answers
3. Repeat until session complete (`question: null`)
4. Generate diagnosis with final patient info

## Error Codes

- `422`: Validation Error

## Best Practices

- Store and reuse `session_id`
- Provide accurate patient demographics
- Handle image questions if supported
- Follow urgency recommendations
