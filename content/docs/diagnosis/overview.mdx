The Diagnosis API is a backend service that powers intelligent medical question‑and‑answer and diagnostic workflows.
It’s built around a clinical AI model that can conduct structured medical interviews through iterative questioning, adapt each next question based on previous answers, and build a detailed picture of the patient’s condition — ultimately providing a differential diagnosis along with related care recommendations.

## Conversational API
Designed for interactive, real-time diagnostic sessions. It allows you to start a session with patient details, answer questions, and get diagnosis results.
### Workflow
Integrating the Diagnosis API is straightforward — just three API calls to go from patient input to complete diagnostic results.
<div className="fd-steps">
  <div className="fd-step">
    <div className="fd-step-content">
#### Step 1 — Start a session
Send patient details to start a session.  
Receive a `session_id` and the first question.
    </div> 
  </div>
    <div className="fd-step">
    <div className="fd-step-content">
#### Step 2 — Send answers 
Send answers with the `session_id` and receive the next question.  
Repeat until the API returns `null` for the question.

    </div> 
  </div>
    <div className="fd-step">
    <div className="fd-step-content">
#### Step 3 — Get diagnosis
Provide a session ID to retrieve diagnosis from existing patient data.

<Callout type="info">You can call the Diagnose endpoint at any point during the session to receive results sooner.
However, accuracy improves when the session is completed before diagnosis.</Callout>


### Endpoints

| Method | Path                      | Purpose |
|--------|----------------------------|---------|
| POST   | `/ddx/v1/session`             | Create a session, initialize patient context, and receive the first question. |
| POST   | `/ddx/v1/session/{session_id}/next` | Update an existing session by submitting answers and receiving the next step in the patient's assessment. |
| GET   | `/ddx/v1/session/{session_id}/diagnose`            | Generate final outputs including differential diagnosis, triage, specialist, and self-management advice. |

## Stateless API
Designed for non-interactive use cases where you send all patient information in a single request and receive a question or a complete diagnosis without iterative questioning.


### Ask Endpoint

Send patient details and findings to receive a question based on the patient's information. This gives the API user the power to control the flow of the conversation.




<Callout type="info">This endpoint is deterministic: the same patient details and findings will always return the same question. Similar sets of findings may return the same question.</Callout>

### Diagnose Endpoint

Send patient details and findings to receive a set of potential differential diagnoses.


<Callout type="info">Providing additional patient details and findings will enhance the accuracy of the diagnosis.</Callout>




## Requirements
- **Authentication**: The API uses a bearer token for
