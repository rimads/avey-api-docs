title: Overview
description: Conversational AI for clinical data gathering and differential diagnosis generation.
---

The Diagnosis API enables conversational, structured clinical data gathering and generates differential diagnoses, triage recommendations, specialist referrals, and self-management advice.

## When to use
- To interactively collect patient information via text or structured answers.
- To produce a ranked list of possible conditions (differential diagnosis).
- To provide self-management guidance and appropriate care level recommendations.
- To identify the medical specialty most relevant to the patientâ€™s presentation.

## Capabilities
- Differential diagnosis generation from patient symptoms and context.
- Self-management advice based on collected patient data.
- Triage recommendation to determine care urgency.
- Specialist recommendation based on likely conditions.

    participant Patient

    participant AveySession as Avey Session Manager
    participant AveyQNA as Avey QNA Engine

## Quick example
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.avey.ai/ddx/session/" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "input_text": "I have a headache and a fever",
    "age": 35,
    "sex": "male",
    "coding_systems": ["icd10"]
  }'
```

Example response (truncated):

```json
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "question": "How long have you had these symptoms?"
}

```

## Key points before using


- **Authentication**: Bearer token. 
- **Accuracy improves with complete Q&A cycles**: early calls to /ddx/diagnose/ may reduce precision.
