## Workflow

2. Ask questions and submit answers, using free text or codes, and receive an updated `patient_info` object
3. Repeat until session complete (`question: null`).
4. Generate generate diagnosis, specialist, triage, and self_management advice with final `patient_info` object by sending it to /diagnose.
