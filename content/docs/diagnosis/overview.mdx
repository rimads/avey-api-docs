title: What is the Diagnosis API?
sidebar_title: Overview
---
The Diagnosis API is a backend service that powers intelligent medical question‑and‑answer and diagnostic workflows.
It’s built around a clinical AI model that can conduct structured medical interviews through iterative questioning, adapt each next question based on previous answers, and build a detailed picture of the patient’s condition — ultimately providing a differential diagnosis along with related care recommendations.

## Workflow
Integrating the Diagnosis API is straightforward — just three API calls to go from patient input to complete diagnostic results.

  <div className="fd-step">
    <div className="fd-step-content">
### Step 1 — Create a session
Send patient details to start a session.  
Receive a `session_id` and the first question.
    </div> 
  </div>
    <div className="fd-step">
    <div className="fd-step-content">
### Step 2 — Continue the session
Send answers with the `session_id`.  
Repeat until the API returns `null` for the question.

  </div>
    <div className="fd-step">
    <div className="fd-step-content">
### Step 3 — Diagnose
Send final patient data and desired outputs.  
Receive diagnosis, advice, urgency, and specialist recommendations.

<Callout type="info">You can call the Diagnose endpoint at any point during the session to receive results sooner.
However, accuracy improves when the session is completed before diagnosis.</Callout>


## Endpoints 
| Method | Path                       | Purpose |
|--------|----------------------------|---------|
| POST   | `/ddx/session/`             | Create a session, initialize patient context, and receive the first question. |
| POST   | `/ddx/session/{session_id}` | Continue an existing session by submitting answers and receiving the next question. |
| POST   | `/ddx/diagnose/`            | Generate final outputs including differential diagnosis, triage, specialist, and self-management advice. |
