## How to use the API

1. Create a session to initialize patient context and receive the first question.
   - Endpoint: POST `/ddx/session/`
   - Provide either `input_text` (e.g., "I have a headache and a fever") or `chief_findings_codes`, plus basic demographics (age, sex) and desired coding systems.
   - Response includes a `session_id` and the first `question`.

2. Continue the session by submitting answers and retrieving the next question.
   - Endpoint: POST `/ddx/session/{session_id}`
   - Send user free text or a structured `answers` object.
   - The model updates `patient_info` and returns the next `question`. Repeat until `question` is `null`.

3. Generate the final outputs (differential diagnosis, triage, specialist, selfâ€‘management advice).
   - Endpoint: POST `/ddx/diagnose/`
   - Use the final `patient_info` from the session. You can also call this earlier if you only need quick recommendations, but accuracy may be reduced.



### Coding systems

- **Text**: Standard yes/no questions
