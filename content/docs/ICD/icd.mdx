# ICD API

The ICD API extracts International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes from free-text descriptions of symptoms, conditions, and diagnoses.

## Overview

This API enables healthcare applications to:

- Extract ICD-10 codes from natural language descriptions
- Handle multiple symptoms or conditions in a single request
- Return both specific and related ICD codes
- Provide confidence scores for code accuracy
- Support various medical terminology and abbreviations
- Include both primary and secondary diagnoses

## Authentication

All requests require authentication via API key in the request headers:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Error Codes

| Code                  | HTTP Status | Description                                      |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `INVALID_INPUT`       | 400         | Invalid request parameters or empty descriptions |
| `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | 429         | Rate limit exceeded for your plan                |
| `UNAUTHORIZED`        | 401         | Invalid or missing API key                       |

## Best Practices

1. **Descriptive Input**: Provide detailed symptom descriptions for better accuracy.

2. **Context Usage**: Include relevant clinical context when available to improve code selection.

3. **Patient Context**: Provide patient demographics when known to improve specificity.

4. **Confidence Scores**: Use confidence scores to determine reliability. Scores below 0.7 should be reviewed manually.

5. **Related Codes**: Review related codes for more specific alternatives when appropriate.

6. **Code Specificity**: Consider whether you need specific or unspecified codes based on your use case.

## Limitations

- Maximum 10 descriptions per request
- Free plan limited to 5 descriptions per request
- Descriptions should be in English
- Some rare or complex conditions may not be recognized
- Confidence scores are estimates and should not replace clinical judgment
- ICD-9 codes are deprecated but still supported for historical data
