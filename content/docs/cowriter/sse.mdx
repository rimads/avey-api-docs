title: "Notifications SSE"
description: "Stream real-time clinical event notifications with Server-Sent Events (SSE) for medical findings, collaborator questions, and medical alerts."
---
 

## Overview

This SSE endpoint streams real-time updates about clinical findings, collaborator questions, and alert notifications relevant to the ongoing medical session. It allows clients to receive asynchronous, event-driven notifications without polling.

Our SSE provides the following event types:


<Cards className="grid grid-cols-1 ">
  <Card title="new_findings">
 Updated or new clinical findings infred from the Doctor-Patient conversation.  
  </Card>
  <Card title="new_collaborator_question">
Aveyâ€™s AI delivers precision-guided diagnostic questions to empower clinicians and boost diagnosis accuracy.
  </Card>
  <Card title="new_alerts">
Receive medical adjudication alerts powered by Avey's state-of-the-art drug, procedure, and coding models.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Connection details


#### SSE endpoint URL

```http
https://api.avey.ai/cowriter/v1/session/{session_id}/events
```

#### Headers 

```http
Accept: text/event-stream
```


  
<Callout type="info">
  Server-Sent Events are unidirectional (server-to-client), providing an efficient way to stream updates without polling. For interaction requiring client-to-server messaging, consider complementary APIs.
</Callout>

## Event payloads and structure

The SSE stream sends discrete events, each containing an `event` type and a JSON `data` payload, corresponding to one of the following schemas.

### Event data models

| Event Name               | Data Model                      |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `new_findings`           | `FindingEvent`                  |
| `new_collaborator_question` | `CollaboratorQuestionEvent`     |
| `new_alerts`             | `AlertEvent`                    |

## Sample SSE event format

SSE messages follow the standard format with `event` and `data` fields.
```json "
event: new_findings
data: {
  "findings": [
    {
      "id": "123",
      "name": "Hypertension", 
      "status": "present",
      "classification": "subjective",
      "publisher": "Avey AI Model",
      "time": "2025-09-10T13:00:00Z",
      "is_chief": true,
      "parent_concept": {
        "id": "hc123",
        "name": "Cardiovascular Diseases"
      },
      "snomed_id": "38341003"
    }
  ]
}
