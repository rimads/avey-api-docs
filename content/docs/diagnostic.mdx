# Diagnostic API

The Diagnostic API provides conversational AI capabilities to interact with patients, gather clinical data, and generate differential diagnoses based on symptoms and medical history.

## Overview

This API enables healthcare applications to create intelligent diagnostic workflows that can:

- Conduct patient interviews through natural language processing
- Gather comprehensive clinical data based on chief complaints
- Generate evidence-based differential diagnoses
- Provide triage recommendations (Enterprise & Professional plans only)
- Return structured medical codes (ICD-10, SNOMED CT)

## Authentication

All requests require authentication via API key in the request headers:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Rate Limits

## Error Codes

| Code                  | HTTP Status | Description                        |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `INVALID_INPUT`       | 400         | Invalid request parameters         |
| `INVALID_SESSION`     | 400         | Invalid or expired session ID      |
| `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | 429         | Rate limit exceeded for your plan  |
| `UNAUTHORIZED`        | 401         | Invalid or missing API key         |
| `PLAN_LIMITATION`     | 403         | Feature not available in your plan |
| `INTERNAL_ERROR`      | 500         | Internal server error              |

## Best Practices

1. **Session Management**: Always store and reuse the `session_id` returned in responses to maintain conversation continuity.

2. **Patient Context**: Provide as much patient context as possible in the initial request for more accurate diagnoses.

3. **Response Handling**: Check the `response_type` field to determine how to handle the response (follow-up question, no disease, or differential diagnosis).

4. **Triage Recommendations**: Only available for Professional and Enterprise plans. Always follow triage recommendations for patient safety.

5. **Confidence Scores**: Use confidence scores to determine the reliability of the diagnosis. Scores below 0.6 should be treated with caution.

## Limitations

- Free plan responses are limited to predefined yes/no/unsure options
- Enterprise plan required for free-text patient responses
- Triage recommendations only available for Professional and Enterprise plans
- Maximum conversation length varies by plan (Free: 10 questions, Professional: 25 questions, Enterprise: 50 questions)
