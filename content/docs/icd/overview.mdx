title: What is the ICD API?
sidebar_title: Overview
---

The ICD API transforms unstructured clinical text into structured, standardized data by identifying medical conditions and assigning them corresponding ICD-10 codes.  
It streamlines coding workflows, reduces manual effort, and ensures consistency across healthcare systems.
## Use cases
<Cards>
  <Card
    title="Automated ICD coding"
    description="Manual coding slows workflows. Instantly convert clinical text into ICD-10 codes with a single API call."
  />
  <Card
    title="Billing and claims"
    description="Claim rejections often stem from coding errors. Ensure accurate ICD coding for faster, cleaner reimbursement."
  />
  <Card
    title="Data standardization"
    description="Inconsistent diagnosis terms cause system mismatches. Standardize all records using ICD-10 codes."
  />
  <Card
    title="Decision support"
    description="Decision tools need structured data. Supply them with accurate, codified condition outputs."

## How to use the API
Call the ICD API to either extract conditions or return ICD-10 codes.

<Cards>
  <Card title="Extract">
    Send free text and receive a list of identified clinical conditions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Classify">
    Send free text and receive ICD-10 codes for the conditions in the text.
  </Card>
</Cards>

<Callout type="info">Classification may include both generic and complete/specific ICD‑10 codes when available.</Callout>

## Architecture

The ICD API routes your clinical note through Avey’s coding pipeline. Avey parses the note, identifies clinical conditions, and classifies them into standardized ICD‑10 codes using Avey’s internal ICD Engine.
