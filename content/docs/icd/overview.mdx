title: What is the ICD API?
sidebar_title: Overview
---

The ICD API transforms unstructured clinical text into structured, standardized data by identifying medical conditions and assigning them corresponding ICD-10 codes.  
It streamlines coding workflows, reduces manual effort, and ensures consistency across healthcare systems.

## Endpoints
| Method | Path        | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| POST   | `/extract`  | Extract medical conditions from a clinical note. |
| POST   | `/classify` | Classify a clinical note or condition into ICD‑10 codes. |

Full details and "Try it" functionality are available in the [API Reference](#api-reference).

## How to use the API

Provide a single clinical note as input. Use `POST /extract` to get conditions mentioned in the note, or `POST /classify` to get ICD‑10 codes that represent those conditions.

### Input Parameters

| Field                                                  | Type     | Description |
|-------------------------------------------------------|----------|-------------|
| `clinical_note`<span style={{ color: "red" }}>*</span> | `string` | Full, plain‑text clinical note to analyze. |

### Output

- Extract  
  Returns: `conditions: string[]` — medical conditions/diseases mentioned in the note.

- Classify  
  Returns: `icd10: string[]` — ICD‑10 codes corresponding to the note’s conditions. May include both generic and specific codes.

## How it works

The ICD API routes your clinical note through Avey’s coding pipeline. Avey parses the note, identifies clinical conditions, and classifies them into standardized ICD‑10 codes using Avey’s internal ICD Engine.

## Base URL

`https://api.avey.ai`

## Quick example

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.avey.ai/classify" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "clinical_note": "Patient presents with fever and productive cough for 3 days."
  }'
```

Example response (truncated):

```json
{
  "icd10": ["J18.9", "R50.9"]
}
```

## Notes

- Authentication: Bearer token.
- Classification may include both generic and complete/specific ICD‑10 codes when available.
