The Avey API platform provides advanced healthcare capabilities, including medical coding for diagnoses, procedures, and medications. It supports the extraction of clinical conditions from unstructured text, mapping to ICD-10 standards, validation of drugs and procedures, triage recommendations, and assessment of treatment compatibility.

## Onboarding Steps

1. **Request Access**  
   Request access to the Avey API platform by contacting support@avey.ai.

2. **Obtain API Credentials**  
   Upon approval, an API key (Bearer token) will be provided. This token must be stored securely and should never be exposed in public client-side applications.

3. **Review Core Concepts**  
   Familiarize yourself with the authentication process before integration.

4. **Validate Connectivity**  
   Use the Quick Example below to confirm successful authentication and basic request processing.

5. **Proceed to Full Integration**  
   Refer to the API Reference for comprehensive endpoint documentation and implementation guidelines.

---

## Prerequisites

- **API Key (Bearer Token)** issued by Avey  
- An HTTP client (e.g., cURL, Postman, or a server-side HTTP library)  

---

## Core Concepts

### Base URL

Base URL for all Avey APIs:

```
https://api.avey.ai
```


### Authentication
Avey APIs require Bearer token authentication. The token must be included in the `Authorization` header of each request:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```




---

## Quick Example

The following example demonstrates the **Extract Conditions** API. This endpoint accepts a clinical note and returns a list of normalized medical conditions.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.avey.ai/extract-conditions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "clinical_note": "Patient presents with hypertension and type 2 diabetes."
  }'
```
### Expected Response (truncated):

```json
{
  "conditions": [
    { "name": "Hypertension" },
    { "name": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus" }
  ]
}
```
