title: Overview
description: Automated claim validation for medical necessity, billing compliance, and frequency limits.
---

The **Procedure Adjudication API** serves as an intelligent, real-time gatekeeper for medical claims. It automatically evaluates procedure codes (CPT/HCPCS) against patient diagnoses (ICD-10) and historical data to ensure clinical accuracy and billing compliance.

By integrating this API, organizations can prevent denials, ensure medical necessity, and adhere to strict coding standards before a claim ever reaches a payer.

## Violation Types

We categorize claim issues into specific rule types. The API response returns these codes, allowing your system to route errors to the correct workflow.

### 1. Medical Necessity (PLE)

<Violation code="PLE" title="Medical Necessity" level="critical">
This check validates the clinical relationship between the diagnosis and the procedure. It answers: *"Is this procedure medically justified by this condition?"*

*   **Description:** Procedure not justified by diagnoses.
*   **Example Scenario:** A provider bills for a **Chest X-Ray** but the only diagnosis on the claim is **Foot Pain**.

```json
{
  "rule": "PLE",
  "level": "critical",
  "description": "Procedure not justified by diagnoses",
  "cpts": ["71045"],
  "detail": "Diagnosis 'M79.671' (Pain in right foot) does not support procedure '71045'",
  "ref_ids": ["claim-line-1"]
}
```
</Violation>

### 2. Frequency Limits (MUE)

Medically Unlikely Edits (MUE) prevent over-billing by enforcing quantity limits based on anatomical or policy maximums.

#### Daily Limits (MUE1)

<Violation code="MUE1" title="Daily Limits" level="critical">
Flags claims where the units of service exceed what is allowed for a single date of service.

*   **Description:** Procedure quantity exceeds daily limit.
*   **Example Scenario:** Billing **3 units** of an Appendectomy (which can only happen once).

```json
{
  "rule": "MUE1",
  "level": "critical",
  "description": "Procedure quantity exceeds daily limit",
  "cpts": ["44950"],
  "detail": "Total quantity of 3 exceeds limit of 1",
  "ref_ids": ["claim-line-2"]
}
```
</Violation>

#### Lifetime Limits (MUE2)

<Violation code="MUE2" title="Lifetime Limits" level="critical">
Checks the patient's history to ensure "once-in-a-lifetime" procedures aren't billed repeatedly.

*   **Description:** Procedure quantity exceeds daily limit across all claims.
*   **Requirements:** You must provide the `history` array in the request for this check to function.

```json
{
  "rule": "MUE2",
  "level": "critical",
  "description": "Procedure quantity exceeds daily limit across all claims",
  "cpts": ["44950"],
  "detail": "History contains prior instance of '44950' on 2023-05-12"
}
```
</Violation>

### 3. Bundling Integrity (PTP)

**Procedure-to-Procedure (PTP)** edits identify pairs of codes that should not be reported together. These rules, enforced by the National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI), prevent improper payments by defining when a service is considered "integral" to or "mutually exclusive" with another more comprehensive service performed at the same site.

<Callout title="Key Principles">
*   **Mutually Exclusive:** Procedures that achieve the same result or are clinically impossible to perform together.
*   **Integral Procedures:** A "separate procedure" or superficial service that is included in a more complex surgical procedure.
*   **Comprehensive vs. Component:** Identifies when a specific service is deemed a component of a larger procedure. The component code is typically denied when billed alongside the comprehensive code.
</Callout>

#### Hard Stops (PTP0)

<Violation code="PTP0" title="Hard Stops" level="critical">
Codes that are mutually exclusive and can **never** be reported together on the same date of service.

*   **Description:** Procedures cannot be billed together (modifier not allowed).
*   **Action:** One of the codes must be removed.

```json
{
  "rule": "PTP0",
  "level": "critical",
  "description": "Procedures cannot be billed together (modifier not allowed)",
  "cpts": ["99215", "99205"],
  "detail": "Code '99215' includes services described by '99205'",
  "ref_ids": ["claim-line-3", "claim-line-4"]
}
```
</Violation>

#### Soft Stops (PTP1)

<Violation code="PTP1" title="Soft Stops" level="warning">
Codes that are typically bundled but **may** be allowed if performed on separate anatomical sites or distinct sessions, usually requiring a specific modifier (e.g., -59, -25).

*   **Description:** Procedures cannot be billed together (modifier allowed with documentation).
*   **Action:** Review documentation. If appropriate, apply a modifier to bypass the edit.

```json
{
  "rule": "PTP1",
  "level": "warning",
  "description": "Procedures cannot be billed together (modifier allowed with documentation)",
  "cpts": ["17000", "17003"],
  "detail": "Modifier required to bypass bundling edit"
}
```
</Violation>

## Criticality & Workflows

We categorize every violation into a severity level. This allows you to filter noise and route issues to the right person.

<SeverityGrid />

### Endpoint
`POST /adjudicate`

### Data Requirements

To maximize adjudication accuracy, ensure your request includes:

*   **Procedures:** The CPT codes, dates, and units for the current claim.
*   **Diagnoses:** The ICD-10 codes justifying the procedures.
*   **History:** A list of past procedures. This is **critical** for MUE2 (lifetime) checks. Without history, the API cannot detect if a patient has previously received a non-repeatable service.

## Configuration

You can fine-tune the strictness of the API using the `config` object in your request.

### Filter by Level
Control which violations are returned based on their severity. This is useful if you want to build different views for different users (e.g., showing only Critical errors to a physician).

| Level | Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| `warning` | **Default.** Returns ALL violations (Critical + Warning). |
| `critical` | Returns ONLY Critical violations. Hides coder-level warnings (like PTP1). |

**Request Example:**
```json
{
  "procedures": [...],
  "diagnoses": [...],
  "config": {
    "level": "critical"
  }
}
```
