## How to use the API

This API accepts current and past procedures along with diagnostic context. It returns validation results for each procedure, indicating whether it's justified, if any combinations are unsafe or incompatible, and whether the quantity of usage is acceptable. Use this API before applying or billing procedures to prevent clinical and coding errors.

### Input Parameters

| Field                            | Type                  | Description |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| `current_cpts`<span style={{ color: "red" }}>*</span>         | `string[]`            | One or more CPT codes representing the procedures to validate. |
| `past_cpts`                      | `{ code: string, date: string }[]` | Optional. Past CPT procedures and their dates (ISO format). |
| `primary_icd`<span style={{ color: "red" }}>*</span>          | `string`              | Primary diagnosis (ICD-10 code). |
| `secondary_icds`                | `string[]`            | Optional. Additional diagnoses (ICD-10 codes). |

### Output

Returns an object that includes:
  - Validation results for each procedure:
  - Medical necessity (`justified` or not)
  - Procedure compatibility (e.g., not allowed to be billed together)
  - Quantity validation (based on past history or standard limits)

## How it works

The Procedure API routes your inputs through Avey’s Procedure Engine, which evaluates whether each procedure is clinically and contextually appropriate. It checks for conflicts between procedures, validates associations between procedures and diagnoses, and uses historical context when available — all powered by Avey’s internal mapping systems.
