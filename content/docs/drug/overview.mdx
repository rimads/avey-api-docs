## How to use the API
This API accepts patient context (diagnoses and demographics) and one or more medications as input. It returns clinical validation results indicating whether the medications are necessary, safe, and appropriately dosed. You’ll typically call this API during the treatment recommendation stage, or when reviewing a medication list for contraindications or dosage concerns.


### Input Parameters

| Field              | Type       | Description |
|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| `ndcs`<span style={{ color: "red" }}>*</span>            | `string[]` | One or more NDC codes representing medications. |
| `primary_icd`<span style={{ color: "red" }}>*</span>     | `string`   | Primary diagnosis (ICD-10 code). |
| `secondary_icds`  | `string[]` | Additional diagnoses (ICD-10 codes). |
| `age`<span style={{ color: "red" }}>*</span>             | `number`   | Patient's age. |
| `gender`           | `string`   | Patient's gender. |
| `weight`           | `number`   | Patient's weight (in kg). |


### Output

Returns an object that includes:
  - Validation results for each medication:
  - Medical necessity (`justified` or not)
  - Any detected drug-drug or drug-disease interactions
  - Dosage validation (valid/invalid)
  - Recommended dosage if applicable

## How it works

The Drug API routes your input through Avey's clinical validation pipeline. It checks whether each medication is medically appropriate for the provided conditions, flags any safety risks, and returns dosage recommendations when needed — all handled by Avey’s internal Drug Engine.

No need to manually check clinical guidelines — the Drug API ensures smarter medication validation in real time.
