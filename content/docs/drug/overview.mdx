<Callout type="warn" title="Experimental API">
  The Drug Adjudication API is currently in **Beta**. Features and response schemas are subject to breaking changes and improvements.
</Callout>

The **Drug Adjudication API** acts as a sophisticated clinical safeguard for medication management. It evaluates prescribed drugs against patient demographics, diagnoses, and other medications to ensure safety, medical necessity, and adherence to dosage guidelines.

By integrating this API, healthcare systems can prevent adverse drug events, ensure appropriate prescribing, and reduce pharmacy claim rejections.
