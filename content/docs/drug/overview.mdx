<Callout type="warn" title="Beta availability">
  The Drug Adjudication API is currently in **Beta**. While functional, please anticipate limited medication coverage and potential breaking changes to the API specification.
  
  Currently, medications must be submitted as structured objects. We are working on adding support for standard identifiers like **NDC codes** in upcoming releases.
</Callout>

The Drug Adjudication API serves as a sophisticated clinical safeguard for medication management. It analyzes prescribed medications in the context of patient demographics, diagnoses, and concurrent medical conditions and therapies to ensure safety, medical necessity, and adherence to dosing guidelines.

This API is particularly valuable for pharmacy benefit management (PBM) systems, as it streamlines real-time drug evaluations, reduces claim denials, and ensures accurate, compliant prescribing. By integrating this API, healthcare and PBM platforms can help prevent adverse drug events, promote formulary adherence, and boost the overall efficiency of medication management.

## Data sources

We anchor our adjudication framework in FDA-approved medical standards and clinical guidelines.

## Violation types

We return specific violation codes to help you understand *why* a medication was flagged.

### 1. Medical necessity (DLE)

<Violation code="DLE1" title="Diagnosis mismatch" level="critical">
Ensures the medication is clinically indicated for the patient's diagnosed conditions.

*   **Description:** Diagnoses do not necessitate the use of the medication.
*   **Example:** Prescribing **Metformin** (diabetes) for a patient with only **Hypertension** diagnosis.

```json
{
  "rule": "DLE1",
  "level": "critical",
  "description": "Diagnoses do not necessitate the use of the medication",
  "medications": ["Metformin"]
}
```
</Violation>

<Violation code="DLE2" title="Dosage necessity" level="warning">
Checks if the specific dosage prescribed/claimed is allowed given the diagnosis and the demographics

*   **Description:** Diagnoses do not necessitate the use of the medication in the prescribed dosage.

```json
{
  "rule": "DLE2",
  "level": "warning",
  "description": "Diagnoses do not necessitate the use of the medication in the prescribed dosage",
  "medications": ["Ibuprofen"]
}
```
</Violation>

### 2. Contraindications (DCV)

<Violation code="DCV1" title="Comorbidities contraindication" level="critical">
Identifies if a drug is medically contraindicated to be given, considering the patient's other medical conditions.

*   **Description:** Drug contraindicated with comorbid condition.
*   **Example:** Prescribing **Beta-blockers** to a patient with **Asthma**.

```json
{
  "rule": "DCV1",
  "level": "critical",
  "description": "Drug contraindicated with comorbid condition",
  "medications": ["Propranolol"]
}
```
</Violation>

### 3. Drug interactions (DDV)

<Violation code="DDV1" title="Drug-drug interaction" level="critical">
Detects possible deleterious drug–drug interactions arising from co-administration of multiple therapeutic agents.

*   **Description:** Potential drug–drug interaction detected between prescribed medications.

```json
{
  "rule": "DDV1",
  "level": "critical",
  "description": "Potential drug–drug interaction detected between prescribed medications.",
  "medications": ["Warfarin", "Aspirin"]
}
```
</Violation>

### 4. Dosage safety (DOV)

<Violation code="DOV1" title="Dosage limit exceeded" level="warning">
Flags dosages that exceed recommended maximums for safety, considering age and weight.

*   **Description:** Prescribed dosage exceeds the recommended maximum limit.

```json
{
  "rule": "DOV1",
  "level": "warning",
  "description": "Prescribed dosage exceeds the recommended maximum limit",
  "medications": ["Acetaminophen"]
}
```
</Violation>

### Data requirements

To ensure accurate adjudication, provide as much patient context as possible:

*   **Medications:** The list of drugs to evaluate, defined as structured objects (support for NDC codes is planned).
*   **Diagnoses:** Required to validate medical necessity (DLE & DCV rules).
*   **Age**, **Sex**, **Weight:** Crucial for calculating safe dosages.
